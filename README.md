This poetry generator creates 12 line poems. Each poem is inspired by a single word taken on the command line. 
When running this in the terminal, 

python3 stanza.py [word]

where [word] is the inspiring word. 

It is best to use single syllable words which have an easily imagineable counterpart. 
ie. dark, light, love, death, birth

Single syllable words tend to have the most perfect rhymes, which is important for this program.
